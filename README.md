# Introduction to the challenge

In this competition(Analytics Vidhya(Hackathons)) our client is WNS Analytics, a large MNC company. They want us to identify the right person for a promotion. Currently, this process consists of several steps:
1. They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations and past performance;
2. Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical.
   These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical;
3. At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, 
   KPI completion, etc.,an employee gets a promotion.
